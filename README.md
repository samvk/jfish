# Portfolio | SamVK

<h3>Hi, I'm Sam.</h3>
<p>
    I'm a web developer who loves building apps and bringing designs to life. My go-to technologies right now include <strong>HTML5</strong>, <strong>CSS3</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>(ESNext) — amped with the help of <strong>React</strong> & <strong>Redux</strong> and <strong>PostCSS</strong> & <strong>Sass</strong> — built with the help of <strong>Webpack</strong> and <strong>Babel</strong>. I also work with some <strong>PHP</strong>, <strong>SQL</strong>, and <strong>NodeJS</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    I'm currently working as a Software Engineer at <em>Konica Minolta Business Solutions</em>.
</p>
<p>
    On a personal note: I love metal detecting, watching movies, the theatre, and building things.
